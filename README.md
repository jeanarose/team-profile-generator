## Description
[Team Profile Generator](https://jeanarose.github.io/team-profile-generator) is a CLI designed to collect data about employees and generate a team profile based on the user's data. Team Profile Generator is useful for employees to gather helpful information about each team member, such as their name, ID, email, office number, GitHub username, and school. This application utilized several key technologies:
* `Inquirer` was used to ask the user which team member they wanted to add, followed by subsequent questions such as the team members name and email
* `Node.js` was used to interact with the command line
* `Jest` was used to run tests before the application was built to ensure best practices
* `Classes` and `subclasses` were used to create new employees 
* `Path` was used to create a file path that can be used to create the `output` directory
* `fs` was used to render the HTML and check to see if the `output` directory exists
